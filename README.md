# Friend-Finder
This app matches you with friends similar to you.
After clicking "Take Survey" you will be redirected to a page containing a survey.
All questions must be answered (including a name and photo link)
Upon answering all questions, clicking "submit" will upload your information to the server, which will then check your answers against others. 
The server will then send back the closest match, and the page will display the name and photo of your match in a modal.

An api has also been provided that returns all friends listed in the database with their name, photo, and their answers to the quiz
